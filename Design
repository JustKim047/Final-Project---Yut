#Unfinished Pieces

#Finished Pieces

#Place the Yut board

#Place Player1 and it's pieces at bottom 
#Place Player2 and it's pieces at top

#Set positions for each block of Yut board image

#Make a list to store moves as players can throw more than once 

#Give colours to each of stick values

#Players throw the Yut sticks to determine who starts first
#Find who's result has higher value

#Create loop to move to next player everytime one's turn is over
    #Output who's turn it is
    #Throw Yut sticks by showing sides of the stick randomly
    #Output the name of resulting move highlighted with it's colour
    #Continue to allow player to throw again if it was Yut or Mo 
        #Store moving values to list 
        #Output the name of resulting move highlighted with it's colour
    #Movement of pieces: Do this until list of moves is empty
        #Allow player to select a piece
        #Find where the selected piece can move to, and highlight the blocks using specified colours for each Yut value in list
        #Move piece to where player selects
        #When player moves piece, remove moved value from list
        #Continue to check if piece can catch or piggyback
            #If catch, delete caught piece from board and return it to player's pieces
            #Then allow player who caught the piece to throw again
            #Add value to list of moves
            #If catch piggybacked pieces, delete caught piece from board and return pieces according to the number of pieces that were piggybacked
            #Allow player who caught the piece to throw again according to the number of pieces that were piggybacked
            #Add values to list of moves
            #If piggyback, output x2 beside piece to combine
            #If already piggybacked, output x3 beside piece to combine
        #Once a piece goes through the endpoint, that piece returns to it's original position under player's name with colour changed to gold
    #Check if all pieces of a player is gold
    #Yes = Break
    #No = Move to next player

#GAME OVER: PLAYER# WINS: All pieces of a player went through the goal point
